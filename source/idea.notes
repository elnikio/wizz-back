This is gonna be like an interface to chuck (and perhaps other languages). There's gonna be boxes with code, and you're gonna be able to place buttons, dials, switches, on the boxes to expose parameters. Then you'll be able to connect boxes to one another as if you're chaining together musical instruments.
